# 🎓 ML Player Training Guide

Complete guide to training a high-accuracy ML model (>85% test accuracy) for the Robot Flower Princess game.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
cd /Users/kong/workspace/robot-flower-princess/Robot-Flower-Princess-Claude-API-FastAPI-v4/rfp_autoplay_prediction

make ml-collect-quality-data  # 1. Collect data (~10 min)
make ml-train                 # 2. Train model (~3 min)
# 3. Restart ML Player service (Ctrl+C, then restart)
```

**Result:** Model accuracy jumps from 63% → 85%+ 🎯

---

## 🎯 Goal

Train a high-accuracy ML model that can successfully play the Robot Flower Princess game.

## ⚠️ Current Problem

The current model has only **63% accuracy** because it was trained on synthetic data that doesn't represent real gameplay patterns. This causes:
- Oscillation loops (robot goes back and forth)
- Invalid action predictions
- Poor decision making

## 💡 Why Quality Data Matters

| Metric | Before (Synthetic) | After (Real Data) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Samples | 2,522 | 8,000-12,000 |
| Balance | 1203:1 ❌ | <5:1 ✅ |
| Test Accuracy | 63% | >85% |
| Loop Issues | Frequent | Rare |
| Game Completion | 10-20% | 70-90% |
| Avg Actions/Game | 100 (stuck) | 30-50 |
| Behavior | Stuck in loops | Smooth gameplay |

**Time Investment:** ~15 minutes total
**Result:** Robot plays correctly! 🤖🌸👑

## ✅ Training Steps

### Step 1: Collect Quality Data

**Command:**
```bash
make ml-collect-quality-data
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Backs up old synthetic data
- ✅ Collects from 1000 AI-solved games using heuristic strategy
- ✅ Generates 8,000-12,000 real gameplay samples
- ✅ Analyzes data distribution automatically
- ⏱️ Takes ~10 minutes

**Expected output:**
```
📊 TRAINING DATA ANALYSIS
Total samples: 8,000-12,000
Action Distribution:
  move          2500      25.00%
  rotate_EAST   2000      20.00%
  pick          1500      15.00%
  ...
✅ Quality Checks:
  ✓ Good balance (ratio: 3.2:1)
  ✓ Good sample count (10,234)
```

---

### Step 2: Train Models

**Command:**
```bash
make ml-train
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Trains Random Forest model
- ✅ Trains Gradient Boosting model
- ✅ Saves best model (typically Gradient Boosting)
- ✅ Generates accuracy metrics
- ⏱️ Takes ~3 minutes

**Expected results:**
```
✅ Random Forest:
   Test Accuracy: 0.85-0.88 (85-88%)
   Training Time: ~30 seconds

✅ Gradient Boosting:
   Test Accuracy: 0.87-0.90 (87-90%)
   Training Time: ~2 minutes
```

---

### Step 3: Restart ML Player Service

```bash
# In terminal running ML Player:
Ctrl+C  # Stop current service

# Start with new model:
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --app-dir src
```

**Verify successful load:**
```
✅ Should see: "Loaded best model: gradient_boosting_... (accuracy=0.87)"
```

---

## ✅ Verify Success

After training, verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check model accuracy (should be >0.85)
cat models/gradient_boosting_*_metrics.json | grep test_accuracy

# 2. Check data samples (should be >8000)
wc -l data/training/samples_*.jsonl

# 3. Test the model
# Start a game with ML strategy and verify:
#   - No "Loop detected!" warnings
#   - Robot makes progress toward flowers
#   - Games complete successfully
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting loops after retraining

**Solution:**
1. Check data quality: `poetry run python scripts/analyze_training_data.py`
2. Ensure balance ratio is <5:1
3. Collect from more diverse games (different board sizes, flower counts)

### Issue: Model accuracy is still low (<75%)

**Possible causes:**
1. **Not enough data** - Collect 2000+ games
2. **Poor quality data** - Ensure games are actually successful
3. **Feature mismatch** - Verify `extract_features` matches between training and prediction

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current data
poetry run python scripts/analyze_training_data.py

# If sample count < 10,000, collect more
poetry run python scripts/collect_from_ai_solved_games.py \
    --num-games 3000 \
    --output-dir data/training \
    --strategy heuristic \
    --min-success-rate 0.9

# Retrain
make ml-train
```

### Issue: Model predicts well but still makes mistakes

**Expected behavior:**
- Even 90% accuracy means 1 in 10 predictions will be wrong
- The **validation overrides** and **loop detection** catch most errors
- This is why we have safety mechanisms!

**Solution:**
- This is acceptable if games complete successfully
- Focus on overall game completion rate, not individual predictions

## 🔧 Common Commands

```bash
# See all ML commands
make help

# Analyze current data quality
poetry run python scripts/analyze_training_data.py

# Collect more data (if accuracy <80%)
poetry run python scripts/collect_quality_training_data.py --num-games 2000
make ml-train

# List all trained models
make ml-list-models

# Show data statistics
make ml-stats
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Model is ready when:**
1. Test accuracy >85%
2. Games complete successfully (reach princess with flowers)
3. No loop detection warnings in logs
4. Average <50 actions per game
5. No crashes or invalid action errors

## 🚀 Advanced: Continuous Improvement

Once you have a working model:

1. **Collect from ML games:**
   ```bash
   # After ML model is working well, collect from its own games
   poetry run python scripts/collect_from_ai_solved_games.py \
       --num-games 500 \
       --strategy ml
   ```

2. **Mix datasets:**
   - Keep heuristic data (reliable baseline)
   - Add ML data (learn from itself)
   - Retrain on combined dataset

3. **Monitor performance:**
   - Track game completion rate
   - Watch for new edge cases
   - Collect and retrain monthly

**Remember:** Machine learning is iterative. If the first training doesn't achieve >85% accuracy, collect more data and retrain. Quality data → Quality model! 🎯
