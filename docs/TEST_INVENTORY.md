## Test Pyramid

Our test distribution follows the Testing Pyramid principle:

```
         /\
        /  \  Feature-Component (7 tests)
       /    \  ↑ High-level, Functional
      /------\
     /        \  Integration (11 tests)
    /          \  ↑ API Contract, Cross-boundary
   /------------\
  /              \  Unit (32 tests)
 /                \  ↑ Domain Logic, Fast
/------------------\
```

**Why this distribution?**
- ✅ **Fast Feedback**: 64% are unit tests (run in milliseconds)
- ✅ **Confidence**: Integration & feature tests validate real behavior
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Most tests are isolated and easy to debug
- ✅ **Cost-effective**: Avoids over-reliance on slow E2E tests

**Intention**: **Technical** - Validates core domain entity behavior

**Purpose**:
- Ensure `Game` entity is correctly instantiated with valid constraints
- Verify victory condition detection logic
- Validate domain invariants (board size, positioning)

**How It's Tested**:
```python
def test_board_creation():
    board = Game.create(rows=10, cols=10)
    assert board.rows == 10
    assert board.robot.position == Position(0, 0)
    assert board.princess_position == Position(9, 9)

def test_board_invalid_size():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        Game.create(rows=2, cols=5)  # Too small

def test_board_victory():
    board = Game.create(rows=5, cols=5)
    board.flowers_delivered = board.initial_flower_count
    assert board.get_status() == GameStatus.VICTORY
```

**Benefits**:
- 🎨 **Design Aid**: Forces clear definition of what makes a valid game board

    pos = Position(5, 10)
    assert pos.row == 5
    assert pos.col == 10

def test_position_move():
    pos = Position(5, 5)
    north = pos.move(Direction.NORTH)
    assert north == Position(4, 5)  # Moved up

def test_position_manhattan_distance():
    pos1 = Position(0, 0)
    pos2 = Position(3, 4)
    assert pos1.manhattan_distance(pos2) == 7
```

    assert len(robot.flowers_collected) == 1

def test_robot_give_flowers():
    robot = Robot(position=Position(0, 0))
    robot.pick_flower()
    robot.pick_flower()
    delivered = robot.give_flowers(princess_pos)
    assert delivered == 2
    assert robot.flowers_held == 0
    assert len(robot.flowers_delivered) == 2

def test_robot_give_flowers_multiple_times():

    robot = Robot(position=Position(0, 0))
    robot.pick_flower()
    robot.pick_flower()
    robot.give_flowers(princess_pos)  # 2 flowers

    robot.pick_flower()
    robot.pick_flower()
    robot.pick_flower()
    robot.give_flowers(princess_pos)  # 3 more flowers

    assert len(robot.flowers_delivered) == 5  # Total: 2 + 3
```

**Benefits**:
- 🎨 **Design Aid**: Drove the fix for flower delivery bug (one entry per flower)
- ⚡ **Fast Feedback**: Caught critical business logic error
- 📚 **Documentation**: Shows expected flower tracking behavior
- 🛡️ **Regression Prevention**: Prevents reintroduction of delivery counting bug

## E2E Overlap Analysis

### Overlap Matrix

| Test Level | E2E Overlap | Should Replace with E2E? | Reasoning |
|------------|-------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Unit - Domain Core** | ❌ 0-10% | **NO** | Internal logic, edge cases, E2E can't reach |
| **Unit - Use Cases** | ⚠️ 40-60% | **NO** | Much faster, better isolation, essential for TDD |
| **Integration - API** | ✅ 60-80% | **NO** | Faster for API contract testing, better validation coverage |
| **Feature-Component** | ✅ 70-90% | **MAYBE** | Similar to E2E but faster, keep unless E2E already exists |

### Detailed Analysis by Category

#### Category 1: **No E2E Overlap - Keep All Unit Tests**

These tests **cannot** be replaced by E2E:

1. **Domain Logic Tests** (`test_board.py`, `test_position.py`, `test_robot.py`)
   - Test internal calculations, invariants, edge cases
   - E2E only sees side effects, not the logic itself
   - **Example**: Position.manhattan_distance() calculation
   - **Verdict**: ✅ **Essential** - keep all

2. **Error Path Tests** (`test_error_branch_direction_propagation.py`, `test_rotate_then_fail.py`)
   - Test specific error conditions
   - E2E might not trigger all error paths
   - **Example**: Rotation succeeds but move fails
   - **Verdict**: ✅ **Essential** - keep all

3. **Edge Case Tests** (`test_robot_give_flowers_multiple_times`)
   - Test specific scenarios (multiple deliveries, accumulation)
   - E2E would need many test cases to cover all edge cases
   - **Example**: Testing flower accumulation across 3+ deliveries
   - **Verdict**: ✅ **Essential** - keep all

#### Category 2: **Some E2E Overlap - Keep for Fast Feedback**

These tests overlap with E2E but provide unique value:

4. **Use Case Tests** (`test_use_cases.py`, `test_direction_propagation.py`)
   - E2E would test same workflows
   - But unit tests are **100x faster**
   - Enable **TDD workflow**
   - **Example**: Testing direction propagation for all 5 action types
   - **Verdict**: ✅ **Keep** - speed advantage is huge

5. **API Contract Tests** (`test_action_endpoint.py`, `test_create_game.py`)
   - E2E would exercise same API endpoints
   - But integration tests are **50x faster**
   - Better for **input validation testing**
   - **Example**: Testing all invalid direction values
   - **Verdict**: ✅ **Keep** - better for contract testing

#### Category 3: **High E2E Overlap - Evaluate Case by Case**

These tests significantly overlap with E2E:

6. **Workflow Tests** (`test_actions_deterministic.py`)
   - E2E would test exact same workflow
   - Feature tests are **faster** but overlap is high
   - **Decision Point**: If E2E tests exist, could remove these
   - **Example**: Pick → Drop → Give sequence
   - **Verdict**: ⚠️ **Evaluate** - keep if no E2E, remove if redundant

7. **Basic Feature Tests** (`test_actions_unified.py`)
   - E2E would test same features
   - Feature tests have speed advantage
   - **Decision Point**: Value depends on E2E test suite size
   - **Example**: Testing obstacle cleaning
   - **Verdict**: ⚠️ **Evaluate** - keep for fast feedback unless E2E is comprehensive

#### Category 4: **Critical Feature Tests - Keep Despite Overlap**

These tests overlap with E2E but are too important to remove:

8. **AI Solver Tests** (`test_autoplay_end_to_end.py`)
   - E2E might test basic autoplay
   - But feature tests cover **many edge cases**
   - AI is **complex** and needs thorough testing
   - **Example**: 7 different autoplay scenarios with obstacles
   - **Verdict**: ✅ **Keep** - AI needs comprehensive testing

- Time to fix: 5 minutes vs. 30+ minutes

**Maintenance**:
- Unit tests: Stable, rarely break from unrelated changes
- E2E tests: Brittle, break from UI/timing changes
- Maintenance cost: Low vs. High

#### 3. **When to Add E2E Tests** ⚠️

**DO add E2E tests for**:
- ✅ User workflows (happy path only)
- ✅ Visual regression (UI rendering)
- ✅ Browser compatibility
- ✅ Cross-system integration (if applicable)

**DON'T add E2E tests for**:
- ❌ Edge cases (use unit tests - faster)
- ❌ Error handling (hard to trigger in E2E)
- ❌ API validation (integration tests better)
- ❌ Code coverage (wrong tool)

**Recommended E2E Suite Size**: 5-10 tests maximum

#### 4. **Identified Gaps** ⚠️

**Missing Tests**:
- `configurator` hexagon (0 tests)
- `shared` utilities (partial coverage)
- Performance/load testing

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
- Property-based testing for Position calculations
- Mutation testing to verify test quality
- Contract tests between hexagons

#### 5. **Best Practices Demonstrated** 🌟

### 🎓 Learning from This Test Suite

**For Other Projects**:

1. **Prioritize Speed**: Fast tests enable TDD and are run more often
2. **Follow Pyramid**: Invest heavily in unit tests, moderately in integration, sparingly in E2E
3. **Test Behavior**: Focus on outcomes, not implementation details
4. **Mock Wisely**: Only mock external dependencies, not domain logic
5. **Name Clearly**: Test names should describe what/when/expected
6. **Measure Value**: Not all tests are equal - prioritize high-value tests

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- ❌ Slow unit tests (> 0.1s each)
- ❌ Flaky tests (pass/fail randomly)
- ❌ Inverted pyramid (more E2E than unit)
- ❌ Testing implementation (coupled to code structure)
- ❌ No edge case coverage
- ❌ Poor test names (test1, test2, etc.)

### Common Testing Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)

```python
def test_robot_pick_flower():
    # ARRANGE: Set up test data
    robot = Robot(position=Position(0, 0))

    # ACT: Execute the behavior
    robot.pick_flower()

    # ASSERT: Verify the outcome
    assert robot.flowers_held == 1
```

**When to use**: All tests (standard pattern)

---

#### Pattern 2: Given-When-Then (BDD style)

```python
def test_autoplay_with_obstacles():
    # GIVEN a board with obstacles
    board = create_board_with_obstacles()

    # WHEN autoplay is triggered
    result = autoplay_use_case.execute(AutoplayCommand(game_id))

    # THEN the AI should clean obstacles and complete
    assert result.success is True
```

**When to use**: Feature-component tests (business scenarios)

---

#### Pattern 3: Test Data Builders

```python
def make_empty_board():
    robot = Robot(position=Position(1, 1), orientation=Direction.EAST)
    board = Game(rows=3, cols=3, robot=robot, princess_position=Position(2, 2))
    board.flowers = set()
    board.obstacles = set()
    return board
```

**When to use**: Complex setup that's reused across tests

---

#### Pattern 4: Mocking External Dependencies

```python
with patch("hexagons.aiplayer.domain.core.entities.game_solver_player.GameSolverPlayer.solve",
           return_value=[("rotate", Direction.NORTH), ("move", Direction.NORTH)]):
    use_case = AutoplayUseCase(repo)
    result = use_case.execute(AutoplayCommand(game_id="a1"))
```

**When to use**: Testing integration without running expensive dependencies

---

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Symptom: Test is slow (> 0.1s)

**Possible Causes**:
- ❌ Using real database instead of in-memory
- ❌ Not mocking external services
- ❌ Creating too much test data
- ❌ Running actual AI solver (should mock)

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Use `InMemoryGameRepository`
- ✅ Mock expensive operations
- ✅ Create minimal test data
- ✅ Mock `GameSolverPlayer.solve()`

---

#### Symptom: Test is flaky (passes/fails randomly)

**Possible Causes**:
- ❌ Tests share state (not independent)
- ❌ Tests depend on execution order
- ❌ Using random data without seeding
- ❌ Time-dependent assertions

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Use fixtures to ensure clean state
- ✅ Make tests runnable in any order
- ✅ Use deterministic test data
- ✅ Mock time-dependent functions

---

#### Symptom: Test passes but doesn't catch bugs

**Possible Causes**:
- ❌ Testing implementation, not behavior
- ❌ Assertions too loose (e.g., `assert x is not None`)
- ❌ Not testing edge cases
- ❌ Mocking too much (testing mocks, not code)

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Test outcomes, not method calls
- ✅ Use specific assertions
- ✅ Add edge case tests
- ✅ Only mock external dependencies

---

#### Symptom: Test is hard to understand

**Possible Causes**:
- ❌ Unclear test name
- ❌ Too much setup
- ❌ Testing multiple things
- ❌ No comments on complex logic

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Use descriptive names (what, when, expected)
- ✅ Extract setup to fixtures
- ✅ One assertion per test (or closely related)
- ✅ Add comments for non-obvious setup

---

### Test Naming Conventions

#### Pattern: `test_<what>_<condition>_<expected>`

**Examples**:
- ✅ `test_board_creation` - Good (simple case)
- ✅ `test_board_invalid_size` - Good (condition clear)
- ✅ `test_robot_give_flowers_multiple_times` - Good (complex scenario)
- ✅ `test_autoplay_blocked_path_drop_and_clean` - Good (describes strategy)
- ❌ `test_1` - Bad (not descriptive)
- ❌ `test_robot` - Bad (too vague)
- ❌ `test_it_works` - Bad (not specific)

---

| Component | Target | Current | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Domain Entities** | 95%+ | ~95% | ✅ Excellent |
| **Use Cases** | 90%+ | ~90% | ✅ Good |
| **API Routers** | 85%+ | ~85% | ✅ Good |
